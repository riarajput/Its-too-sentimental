A little about us : 

I'am a graduate student in Information Systems at Northeastern University and is an aspiring Data Scientist. My skill set includes the supervised learning concepts of Machine Learning and I'am avid learner of neural networks. Over the years, I have understood the importance of Artificial Intelligence in today's world and have developed a keen interest to dig in further in this field. This little initiative of ours is taken in order to make us more proficient with the NLP concepts, hence its a request to please bear with us if we make minor mistakes. We are still learners!!
