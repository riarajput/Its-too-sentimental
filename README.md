# Its-too-sentimental
Hi all, this is a public repository with me as one of the owner's and Abhilash Mandlekar as the co owner. We have created this repository in order to present our findings in the field of Natural Language Processing. We are looking forward to perform social media sentiment analysis on customer reviews for various items of different brands on the well known social media platform Twitter. A little about us : I'am a graduate student in Information Systems from Northeastern University and is an aspiring Data Scientist. My skill set includes the supervised learning concepts of Machine Learning and I'am avid learner of neural networks.
