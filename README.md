# Its-too-sentimental
#### Hi all, this is a public repository with me as one of the owner's and Abhilash Mandlekar as the co owner. 
#### We have created this repository in order to present our findings in the field of Natural Language Processing. 
#### We are looking forward to perform social media sentiment analysis on customer reviews for various items of different brands on the well known social media platform Twitter. 
A little about us : 

-- Ria Rajput

I'am a graduate student in Information Systems at Northeastern University and is an aspiring Data Scientist. My skill set includes the supervised learning concepts of Machine Learning and I'am an avid learner of neural networks. Over the years, I have understood the importance of Artificial Intelligence in today's world and have developed a keen interest to dig in further in this field. This little initiative of ours is taken in order to make us more proficient with the NLP concepts, hence its a request to please bear with us if we make minor mistakes. We are still learners!! I hope you guys enjoy and learn from this repository as we will be posting a lot of cool stuff soon!

I'm a graduate student of Computer Science at University of North Carolina at Charlotte with concentration in Data Science. I am always interested to take out meaningful facts from the data by doing data analysis or predictive analysis. We will collectively work by applying  the Machine Learning concepts along with Natural Language Processing models to the dataset of customer reviews. By implementing this, we aim to deep dive into the large Twitter's dataset, to do the predictive analysis, and analyzing the future trends of different brands. As mentioned by Ria , "We are still learners!!". 

If you have any suggestions, please reach out to us on our emails which are riarajput27@gmail.com and abhilash.mandlekar@gmail.com.
